# Robinhood Web UI
A simple web UI for Robinhood. No real data. Still a work in process :)

## But why?
I really like Robinhood UI, and I loved to imagine how it would look like on the web. Also, with UI engineer interviews coming up, I wanted to brush up on some HTML/CSS and javascript. So there you have it!

## Disclaimer
The design and code are done by me using `create-react-app`. The stock chart is implemented using HighCharts (http://www.highcharts.com/products/highstock) and `react-highcharts` library.
